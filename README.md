# golang-lua-test

This is just a test environment for executing and binding lua code with go.

I frist tried [go-lua](https://github.com/Shopify/go-lua) but quickly changed to [gopher-lua](https://github.com/yuin/gopher-lua).

## Play with go and lua

To play with go and lua, just checkout this repo

    git clone git@github.com:kuetemeier/golang-lua-test.git

and then build and execute it

    go build
    ./golang-lua-test

Have fun! :-)
